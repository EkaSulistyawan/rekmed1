# Medical Record (Prototype v1)

Prerequisite:
  - Metamask (https://metamask.io/)
  - Ethereum (https://coincodex.com/article/2994/how-to-create-an-ethereum-wallet/)
  - Acquired ETH playground from faucet (https://faucet.ropsten.be/)
  
⚠️I just found that Metamask API changed, and the Ropsten faucet is turned off. Tho, Ethereum still opened ⚠️
